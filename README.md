# Testing with localstack

If you don't do anything else, then all the testing (that gives you the [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/adaptris/interlok-aws/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/adaptris/interlok-aws) score) is done via mocking to check behaviour. However, there is the ability to perform some limited integration tests using localstack as the AWS provider. The expectation is that localstack is spun up in a separately; if you have docker-compose then you can use `docker-compose up` with this configuration file.

```
version: '3.2'
services:
  localstack:
    image: localstack/localstack
    environment:
      - SERVICES=s3,sqs,sns
    ports:
      #Management - http://localhost:8025
      - "8025:8080"
      #SNS - http://localhost:4575
      - "4575:4566"
      #SQS - http://localhost:4576
      - "4576:4566"
      #S3 - http://localhost:4572
      - "4572:4566"
      #KMS - http://localhost:4599
      - "4599:4566"
```

## Enabling the localstack tests

For each sub module that you want to enable tests for; create a file build.properties with a value enables the localstack tests. It defaults to false which disables the tests and prints something to that effect on System.err

```
junit.localstack.tests.enabled=true
```

If you need to override various ports and other things, then check the contents of unit-tests.properties.template in the appropriate `src/test/resources` directory.

# AWS Kinesis

## AWS Kinesis + Windows

The AWS Kinesis component uses the simplified AWS kinesis producer; under the covers this spawns a native executable. Since it's native executables you may need to inspect `amazon-kinesis-producer.jar` manually to check that your OS is represented. We have found that sometimes the _Windows_ binary is missing); since the underlying system is opaque to us, this well be intentional on Amazon's part. A listing of recent jar files reveals :

version | Windows | MacOS | Linux |
-------|------------| ------| -----|
0.13 | __No__ | Yes | Yes |
0.13.1| Yes | Yes | Yes |
0.14|  __No__ | Yes | Yes |
0.14.1| __No__ | Yes | Yes |

That table was compiled by just eyeballing the jar file :

```
$ jar -tvf build/distribution/lib/amazon-kinesis-producer.jar | grep native
     0 Wed Jul 31 22:20:56 BST 2019 amazon-kinesis-producer-native-binaries/
     0 Wed Jul 31 22:20:56 BST 2019 amazon-kinesis-producer-native-binaries/osx/
     0 Wed Jul 31 22:20:56 BST 2019 amazon-kinesis-producer-native-binaries/linux/
     0 Wed Jul 31 22:20:56 BST 2019 amazon-kinesis-producer-native-binaries/windows/
11797944 Wed Jul 31 22:20:56 BST 2019 amazon-kinesis-producer-native-binaries/osx/kinesis_producer
65780579 Wed Jul 31 22:20:56 BST 2019 amazon-kinesis-producer-native-binaries/linux/kinesis_producer
3792384 Wed Jul 31 22:20:56 BST 2019 amazon-kinesis-producer-native-binaries/windows/kinesis_producer.exe
```

If you need to pin to a specific version then we suggest you something like this when managing your dependencies (gradle)

```
  interlokRuntime ("com.adaptris:interlok-aws-kinesis:3.11-SNAPSHOT") {
    changing=true
    exclude group: "com.amazonaws", module: "amazon-kinesis-producer"
  }
  // 0.13 and 0.14 don't contain the windows binaries...
  interlokRuntime ("com.amazonaws:amazon-kinesis-producer:0.13.1")
```

## AWS Kinesis + docker

Note that the native binary on Linux is compiled against `glibc` which means that you may get a stacktrace that looks like this (generally on alpine based images, since they use _muslc_ as the standard C library rather than _glibc_). It's probably easier at this point to choose a docker image that isn't alpine based.

# AWS SDK v2

The AWS SDK for Java 2.x is a major rewrite of the 1.x code base built
on top of Java 8+. It includes many updates, such as improved
consistency, ease of use, and strongly enforced immutability. A lot of
the configuration is the same from an Interlok end-user point of view,
although this isn't guaranteed.

There are also several features that are not yet available is the new
SDK: S3 transfer manager, S3 encryption client, DynamoDB document APIs,
DynamoDB encryption client and SQS Client-side Buffering; plus Progress
Listeners.
